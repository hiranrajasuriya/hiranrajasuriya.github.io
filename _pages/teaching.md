# Learning
## Selected Undergraduate Modules
Up until the last semester as an undergraduate, I was involved in deep-learning research based on heuristic approaches. However, the ‘Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence’ module delivered by <a href = 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4-S204cAAAAJ&hl=en'><b>Dr. Prathapasinghe Dharmawansa</b></a> made me realize the power and versatility of statistical machine learning and it catalyzed a passion to explore statistical approaches in medical image analysis. 

### Advanced Courses
