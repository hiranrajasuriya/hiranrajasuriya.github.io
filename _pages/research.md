## Past Projects
* **Zooxanthallae - Reverse Engineering of Coral Structures for Coral Restoration**
  - *Voluntary, Undergraduate Research and Design Project* 
  - *The 1st phase of the project  Zooxanthellae replantation of corals was carried out in 2018. However, the deposited structure showcased minimul growth during the observation period of 2018 - 2020. Therefore, reengineered and designed new coral structures, which showed a substantial growth in the period of few months.*
