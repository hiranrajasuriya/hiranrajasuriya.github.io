## Cooling Load Calculation
The cooling load calculation was done considering a lecture hall at the university permises. *CLF/ CLTD* method was followed for the calculation. 
* Following steps were carried out in order to obtain the cooling load
  - Building orientation and dimensioning
  - Equipment specification and buidling material study
  - Infiltration and Ventilation level
* Calculations were done under four (4) conditons;
  - 20% fresh air supply for 24<sup>0</sup>C and 50% Relative Humidity (RH) internal conditions
  - 20% fresh air supply for 26<sup>0</sup>C and 60% RH internal conditions
  - Without fresh air supply for 24<sup>0</sup>C and 60% RH internal conditions
  - Without fresh air supply for 26<sup>0</sup>C and 60% RH internal conditions

## Wind Turbine Installation
There are several considerations that needed to be taken into account before the installation of a Wind Turbine, and these factors were identified and evaluated thoroughly through this project. *Rayleigh p.d.f.* was used in calculation.
* The following calculations and simulations were carried out;
  - Annual Energy Production (AEP) was calculated for two given Wind Turbine models with manufacturer specified data
  - Develop a site specific power controlling strategy for a given rotor
  - Simulations were done in Matlab considering both Fixed and Variable speed control mechancisms.

## Domestic Solar PV Installation
Sri lanka having high *Global Horizontal Irridiation* levels has the potential to generate power using solar panels to facilitate domestic power requirements. Through this project the parameters considered for a solar PV installation and related calculations were done considering personal residence location.

## Converging - Diverging Nozzle 
Conducted analytical calculations in Matlab for a rocket to understand the practical implications of the Converging - Diverging Nozzle. 
* Calculations were carried out for Ideal and Real condtions using;
  - Tsiolkovsky rocket equation
  - Effective Exhaust Velocity
  - Study of Flow Behaviour
* The following conditions were studied;
  - Nozzle exit diameter variation with Altitude
  - Thrust variation with Altitude under Ideal conditions
  - Thrust variation with Altitude under General conditions

## Production Efficiency Improvement Case Study 
The case study was performed at *Sri Lankan Airlines*. The process flow at the Composite Workshop was mainly focused. 
* The following tasks were carried out during the project. 
  - Gathering current process flow data during field visits
  - Literature study
  - Simulation of the current workflow using Technomatrix Plant Simulation software
  - Identifying potential improvements
  - Validating suggested improvements through simulation.

<!-- ## Image Downsampling Processor -->
<!-- Designed and simulated/implemented a processor that could down-sample an input image using Vivado Design Suite. The input image was transmitted to the processor where the image was down-sampled and once finished, the results were sent back for display purposes. -->
