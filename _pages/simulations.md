## Production Efficiency Improvement Case Study 
The case study was performed at *Sri Lankan Airlines*. The process flow at the Composite Workshop was mainly focused. The following tasks were carried out during the project. 
* Gathering current process flow data during field visits
* Literature study
* Simulation of the current workflow using Technomatrix Plant Simulation software
* Identifying potential improvements
* Validating suggested improvements through simulation.

## Continuous and Discrete Wavelet Transforms
Implemented continuous and discrete wavelet transforms using built-in MATLAB functions and applied them for denoising and compression of different signals. 

In the context of continuous wavelet transforms (CWT), there are many wavelet families such as Shannon, Mexican hat, Morlet, etc. However, the drawbacks of CWT include highly redundant computations which leads to the requirement of additional computational power and time consumption. Avoiding this, in discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the scaling and translation are performed in a discrete manner.

## Branched Cylinders: Dendritic Tree Approximations
Explored some of the time independent electrical properties of single branched cables. Branched cables are an important means of modelling the passive electrical properties of axonal and dendritic trees. For convenience, trees exhibiting only one order of branching were considered. Nevertheless, the principles could be easily extended to higher order trees.

In the above diagram, V<sub>1</sub>,V<sub>21</sub> and V<sub>22</sub> are the membrane potentials of the respective branches. d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>21</sub> and d<sub>22</sub> are the diameters of the parent and daughter branches respectively and X is axial distance.

By solving the differential equations with the given nodal and boundary conditions, steady-state voltage profile in each branch could be determined.

## Properties of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations
Many of the properties of the propagating action potential are similar to the membrane action potential. The features; <b>threshold, refractoriness</b> (absolute and relative), <b>repetitive activity, temperature dependence</b> that are observed physiologically, were simulated using the Hodgkin-Huxley equations.

## Mathematical Modelling of Compartmental Systems
Many compartmental systems can be represented by a series of first-order differential equations.

## Image Downsampling Processor
Designed and simulated/implemented a processor that could down-sample an input image using Vivado Design Suite. The input image was transmitted to the processor where the image was down-sampled and once finished, the results were sent back for display purposes.
