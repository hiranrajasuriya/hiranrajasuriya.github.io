<div style="text-align: justify; width: 800px">
I am a Graduate Research Engineer at University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka. Currently, I am working on electric conversion of IC engine tuk-tuks, which are a popular method of public transportation in Sri Lanka. My recent research interests lie in alternative fuels, and renewable energy. More broadly, I am keen on studying combustion and environment and applying mechanical design knowledge to develop practical solutions to achieve sustainable transportation.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
	I completed my Bachelors in Biomedical Engineering (BME) with First Class Honors at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering (ENTC), University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka and received the gold medal for the best academic performance in the BME specialization. My undergraduate thesis project was on "Deep Geometric Framework to Predict Antibody-Antigen Binding Affinity" under the supervision of <a href = 'https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=VhyUxgcAAAAJ&hl=en'> Dr. Subodha Charles</a>. This research project was a collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravinda-munasinghe-658a9982/">Dr. Aravinda Munasinghe</a>, Senior Research Scientist at Pfizer Inc., USA. During the undergraduate internship at Effective Solutions (Pvt) Ltd., Sri Lanka, I deployed deep-learning based models to predict Diabetic Retinopathy severity and segment neovascularization using fundus images. Further, as self-initiated research projects, I have worked on developing a paediatric anaesthesia monitoring system using EEG and ECG signals.
