<div style="text-align: justify; width: 800px">
I am a Graduate Research Engineer at University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka. Currently, I am working on electric conversion of IC engine tuk-tuks, which are a popular method of public transportation in Sri Lanka. It is a Research Project funded by Innovate UK – Energy Catalyst Round 9 – Early-Stage competition funding, Collaboration with University of Surrey (UK), Alta Vision Solar (PVT) Ltd (SL). My recent research interests lie in alternative fuels, and renewable energy. More broadly, I am keen on studying automotive powertrain, combustion, and applying mechanical design knowledge to develop practical solutions to achieve sustainable transportation.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
	I completed my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering (ME) with First Class Honors at the Department of Mechanical Engineering (DoME), University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. My self-initiated undergraduate thesis project was on "Investigating Vehicle Yaw Stability with Active Steering and Torque Vectoring" under the supervision of <a href = 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kDf7wTIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao'> Dr. J. R. Gamage</a>. During the undergraduate internship at Diesel and Motor Engineering (DIMO) PLC., Sri Lanka, I obtained hands on experience working on many automotive engine models, and learned preventive maintenance work carried on vehicles. I was awarded the Migara Ratnatunga Trust Awards on Industrial Training for University Undergraduates - 2021 / 2022 (Field - Mechanical Engineering) , presented by Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL).
