<div style="text-align: justify; width: 800px">
I am a Graduate Research Engineer at University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka. Currently, I am working on electric conversion of IC engine tuk-tuks, which are a popular method of public transportation in Sri Lanka. It is a Research Project funded by Innovate UK, collaboration with University of Surrey (UK), Alta Vision Solar (PVT) Ltd (SL). My recent research interests lie in alternative fuels, and renewable energy. More broadly, I am keen on studying automotive powertrain, combustion, and applying mechanical design knowledge to develop practical solutions to achieve sustainable transportation.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
	I completed my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering (ME) with First Class Honors at the Department of Mechanical Engineering (DoME), University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. My self-initiated undergraduate thesis project was on "Investigating Vehicle Yaw Stability with Active Steering and Torque Vectoring" under the supervision of a panel including two senior lecturers. During the undergraduate internship at Diesel and Motor Engineering (DIMO) PLC., Sri Lanka, I obtained hands on experience working on many automotive engine models, and learned preventive maintenance work carried on vehicles. I was awarded the Migara Ratnatunga Trust Awards on Industrial Training for University Undergraduates - 2021 / 2022 (Field - Mechanical Engineering) , presented by Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL).
