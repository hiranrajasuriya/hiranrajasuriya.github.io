<div style="text-align: justify; width: 800px">
I am a Graduate Research Intern at the Bioinformatics Institute, Singapore. Currently, I am working on Multi-instance Learning and Multi-task Learning based models for Computational Pathology, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=9ebsWAoAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Lee Hwee Kuan</a>. My recent research interests lie in pattern recognition in histopathological images. More broadly, I am keen on studying statistical learning theory and applying theoretical knowledge to develop tools and frameworks for biomedical/ biological image analysis.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
	I completed my Bachelors in Biomedical Engineering (BME) with First Class Honors at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering (ENTC), University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka and received the gold medal for the best academic performance in the BME specialization. My undergraduate thesis project was on "Deep Geometric Framework to Predict Antibody-Antigen Binding Affinity" under the supervision of <a href = 'https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=VhyUxgcAAAAJ&hl=en'> Dr. Subodha Charles</a>. This research project was a collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravinda-munasinghe-658a9982/">Dr. Aravinda Munasinghe</a>, Senior Research Scientist at Pfizer Inc., USA. During the undergraduate internship at Effective Solutions (Pvt) Ltd., Sri Lanka, I deployed deep-learning based models to predict Diabetic Retinopathy severity and segment neovascularization using fundus images. Further, as self-initiated research projects, I have worked on developing a paediatric anaesthesia monitoring system using EEG and ECG signals.
