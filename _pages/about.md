<div style="text-align: justify; width: 800px">
I'm a Visiting Instructor at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. 
My current research interests lie in sparse signal processing, structured sparsity in inverse problems, and compressed sensing. Specifically, I am engaged with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=xplw9-gAAAAJ">Prof. Marco F. Duarte </a> on the exploiting structured sparsity of affine subspaces, in relation to common denoising algorithms. More broadly, I am keen on research on mathematical analysis, optimization and statistical learning theory in machine learning. Before my current exploration in the theoretical domain, I had experience and publications in application-oriented research: Point Cloud Segmentation using Graph Neural Networks, Resource-constrained Object detection for self driving, and Channel estimation and RIS configuration for OFDM (5G telecommunication) systems. During these prior projects, I discovered my passion for the underlying geometric and algebraic structures, and how to exploit these structures for resource efficient and robust algorithms.

	I completed my undergraduate engineering degree with First Class honors with the gold medal for my cohort at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering (ENTC), and the gold medal from the faculty of Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. My final year thesis project was on "Optical microscopy optimisation through compressive sensing and reconstruction" under the supervision of <a href="https://centerforadvancedimaging.harvard.edu/people/dushan-wadduwage-phd/">Dr. Dushan Wadduwage</a> and <a href= "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qe5byo4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dr. Chamira Edussooriya</a>. This research project was a part of a collaboration with the <a href="https://wadduwagelab.github.io/">Wadduwage lab</a> at the Centre for advanced imaging at harvard university. I have worked in physics-based human motion prediction in the University of Sydney, Australia during my internship with <a href= "https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=y17ckyIAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Anusha Withana</a>. Further, as self-initiated research projects, I have worked on point cloud segmentation using Graph Neural Networks with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YaEJbvYAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Ranga Rodrigo</a>, and Channel estimation and RIS configuration search with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=4-S204cAAAAJ">Dr. Prathapasinghe Dharmawansa</a>.
